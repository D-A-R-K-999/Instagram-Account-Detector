# Instagram Fake Account Detector

This project is a machine learning model to detect fake Instagram accounts based on various profile features. The model is built using a neural network with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset

The model is trained and tested on a dataset of Instagram profiles, with features that are indicative of a profile being genuine or fake. The dataset is split into `train.csv` and `test.csv`.

### Features

The features used for classification are:
- `profile pic`: Whether the user has a profile picture.
- `nums/length username`: Ratio of numbers to the length of the username.
- `fullname words`: Number of words in the full name.
- `nums/length fullname`: Ratio of numbers to the length of the full name.
- `name==username`: Whether the username is the same as the full name.
- `description length`: Length of the bio/description.
- `external URL`: Whether the profile has an external URL.
- `private`: Whether the profile is private.
- `#posts`: Number of posts.
- `#followers`: Number of followers.
- `#follows`: Number of accounts the user follows.
- `fake`: The target variable (1 for fake, 0 for genuine).

## Model

The detection model is a sequential neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture is as follows:

- **Input Layer:** 11 input features.
- **Dense Layer:** 50 neurons, ReLU activation.
- **Dense Layer:** 150 neurons, ReLU activation.
- **Dropout Layer:** 30% dropout rate.
- **Dense Layer:** 150 neurons, ReLU activation.
- **Dropout Layer:** 30% dropout rate.
- **Dense Layer:** 25 neurons, ReLU activation.
- **Dropout Layer:** 30% dropout rate.
- **Output Layer:** 2 neurons (for 2 classes), Softmax activation.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and uses categorical cross-entropy as the loss function.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

### Prerequisites

- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the `.ipynb` file)

### Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage

The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (`Instagram_Detector.ipynb`) that contains the complete workflow from data loading to model training and evaluation. You can run the notebook to see the process.

To make predictions on a new Instagram profile, you can use the saved model (`fake_instagram_model.keras`) and the scaler (`scaler.pkl`). Here is an example of how to do it:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np
import joblib

# Load the trained model and the scaler
model = load_model('fake_instagram_model.keras')
scaler = joblib.load('scaler.pkl')

# Example of a new sample (raw feature values)
new_sample_raw = np.array([[1, 0.27, 0, 0.0, 0, 53, 0, 0, 32, 1000, 955]])

# Scale the new sample
new_sample_scaled = scaler.transform(new_sample_raw)

# Make a prediction
prediction = model.predict(new_sample_scaled)
predicted_class = np.argmax(prediction[0])

print(f"Prediction: {'Fake Account' if predicted_class == 1 else 'Genuine Account'}")
print(f"Class probabilities: {prediction[0]}")
```

## Results

The model achieves a good accuracy in distinguishing between fake and genuine accounts. The performance on the test set is as follows:

- **Accuracy:** ~88%
